## Datasets

Our datasets include a combination of texts that are freely available and with a data license agreement. Nevertheless, we have published the collected datasets that are freely available datasets in [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) to support further readability studies. Please find the links in the table below:

*Please request your access for Newsela and Simplext corpus (Horacio Saggion) and we will be happy to share our splits upon request.


## Models

We have released all of our pretrained models in [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/):


| Model                                                                                                     | Granularity    | # classes |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|:---------:|
| [BERTIN (ES)](https://huggingface.co/lmvasque/readability-es-benchmark-bertin-es-paragraphs-2class)       | paragraphs     |     2     |
| [BERTIN (ES)](https://huggingface.co/lmvasque/readability-es-benchmark-bertin-es-paragraphs-3class)       | paragraphs     |     3     |
| [mBERT (ES)](https://huggingface.co/lmvasque/readability-es-benchmark-mbert-es-paragraphs-2class)         | paragraphs     |     2     |
| [mBERT (ES)](https://huggingface.co/lmvasque/readability-es-benchmark-mbert-es-paragraphs-3class)         | paragraphs     |     3     |
| [mBERT (EN+ES)](https://huggingface.co/lmvasque/readability-es-benchmark-mbert-en-es-paragraphs-3class) | paragraphs |     3     |
| [BERTIN (ES)](https://huggingface.co/lmvasque/readability-es-benchmark-bertin-es-sentences-2class)        | sentences      |     2     |
| [BERTIN (ES)](https://huggingface.co/lmvasque/readability-es-benchmark-bertin-es-sentences-3class)        | sentences      |     3     |
| [mBERT (ES)](https://huggingface.co/lmvasque/readability-es-benchmark-mbert-es-sentences-2class)          | sentences      |     2     |
| [mBERT (ES)](https://huggingface.co/lmvasque/readability-es-benchmark-mbert-es-sentences-3class)          | sentences      |     3     |
| [mBERT (EN+ES)](https://huggingface.co/lmvasque/readability-es-benchmark-mbert-en-es-sentences-3class) | sentences  |   3   |

For the zero-shot setting, we used the original models [BERTIN](bertin-project/bertin-roberta-base-spanish) and [mBERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-uncased) with no further training. 
Also, you can find our ```TF-IDF+Logistic Regression``` approach in ```model_regression.py```, which is based on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kashnitsky/logistic-regression-tf-idf-baseline/notebook) implementation.


## Reproducibility
We have published all of our datasets and models in [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/). However, as a reference, we have also included our training and data processing scripts in the [source folder](https://github.com/lmvasque/readability-es-benchmark/tree/main/src).
